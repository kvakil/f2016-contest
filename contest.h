/* NOTES:
 *    Row-Major Order: To represent a 2D array (or higher) in
 *    completely kosher C, one can use a one-dimensional array
 *    comprising the rows or columns concatenated.  In "row-major order",
 *    an MxN array A is stored in a one-dimensional array, A', containing
 *    M*N elements (at least), with A[0,0] in A'[0], A[0,1] in A'[1],
 *    ... A[0,N-1] in A'[N-1], A[1,0] in A'[N], etc., or in general with
 *    A[i,j] in A'[j + i * N]. 
 *   
 *    Declaring a C array
 *       double A[5][4]
 *    produces an array of 5 rows each with 4 elements, laid out in
 *    memory in row-major order (that is, passing A or &A[0][0] to a
 *    function expecting a double* will cause the function to see the
 *    elements in row-major order).  Unfortunately, standard C or C++ 
 *    don't direct provide ways of passing such an array with its
 *    bounds, nor do they even have array types (as such) whose bounds
 *    are non-constant.  So in the functions below, you must
 *    explicitly pass in the size of the array argument.
