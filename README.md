# Solutions for the 2016 Berkeley Programming Contest

These are the solutions I wrote for the [2016 Berkeley Programming Contest](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ctest/f2016-contest/) where I placed [second](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ctest/contest/rankings.html). Since the contest is timed (5 hours for 9 questions), much of the code quality is subpar. The algorithms used in the solutions are more interesting than the code itself. Here's a short comment on each problem:

1. Graph Theory: finding number of paths.
2. Graph Theory: finding shortest distance on a weighted graph.
3. Discrete Mathematics: original? (I didn't solve this problem.)
4. Graph Theory: finding maximum path on a weighted graph.
5. Computational Geometry: ray tracing / polygon-in-point.
6. Parsing Input: using binary trees is the way. (I didn't solve this problem because it's long.)
7. Discrete Mathematics: using binary search is necessary here to fit within the time constraints.
8. Discrete Mathematics: literally a textbook problem about textbooks.
9. Graph Theory: the key here is to keep track of whether or not Oski has crossed the lake.
